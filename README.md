# Next.js Project Guide

Welcome to your Next.js project! This project was initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), making it easy to get started with modern web development.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application.

### 2. Editing Your Pages

You can start editing the content by modifying the `pages/index.js` file. The page will automatically update as you save your changes, thanks to hot-reloading.

### 3. API Routes

API routes are a powerful feature of Next.js. You can access them at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This particular endpoint is defined in the `pages/api/hello.js` file.

Files placed in the `pages/api` directory are mapped to `/api/*` paths and are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## 4. Font Optimization

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load the Inter font from Google Fonts.
